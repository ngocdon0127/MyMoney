# MyMoney
A small pet-project I created in order to manage my money.

Before building this app, you have to:
  - Create a MySQL Database which allow Remote SQL.
  - Import file mymoney_db.sql to Database.
  - Config this 4 constants in class Information.java : DB_SERVER, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD and TABLE_TRANSACTION
